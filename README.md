This is pre-release software: feel free to play with it, but be aware that things might not yet be in fully working order and may be subject to change even if they are. Also, it would be great if you could email the author at pipcet@gmail.com with any comments, experiences, bug reports (but feel free to use GitHub instead), and problems.

Build instructions

 * clone recursively
 * `eval $(make env)`
