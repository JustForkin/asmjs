I'm in the process of committing code on GitHub, so not everything is there yet.

This is pre-release software. In fact, it's pre-announcement software: feel free to play with it, but be aware that things might not yet be in fully working order and are subject to drastic change even if they are. Also, it would be great if you could email the author at pipcet@gmail.com with any comments, experiences, bug reports (but feel free to use GitHub instead), and problems.
